/**
 * An artist's page, natively (plan L4, bug list item 52; rebuilt in item 131, now in tabs; the page's
 * artist-view.js, artist-about.js and artist-tabs.js): the count and the name as the heading once the albums come; who
 * they are (ArtistHero: their picture, what they are, their genres, Play and Shuffle; no links); then the tabs
 * (ArtistTabs), every artist's page the same. Overview: their albums in a row, See all opening Discography, then similar
 * artists and albums (ArtistFoot, item 140). Discography: each under its own small heading, their albums, those they
 * appear on, their bands' and those they are credited on; a tile opens the album's page over it with the page's albums
 * as its list, a long press starts selecting. About: the biography, asked for only when About is opened or for a
 * portrait the server hasn't (the page drawn without waiting on other services), and a band's members or a person's
 * bands. The mini player and the row along the foot. A page opened again is drawn at once from what it last had
 * (ArtistPages), and asked for afresh once that is old.
