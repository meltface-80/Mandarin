/**
 * How often the phone's interface list is handed to the Tailscale engine (item 202). The app sends it on every look
 * at the network, and every network callback is a look: a signal-strength change on mobile data among them, several
 * a minute. A list that differs from the last makes the engine look at the network again, rebind and find its
 * addresses; with Wi-Fi and mobile data both up the list can flap, and each flap costs the engine CPU. So a list the
 * same as the last isn't sent at all, and lists that differ go at most once in [MIN_GAP_MS]: a change in the gap is
 * sent when the gap is up, as it is then ([Action.Later]), so a flap that undoes itself costs nothing and a real
 * change is never lost.
