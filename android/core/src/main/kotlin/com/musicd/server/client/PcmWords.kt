/**
 * Samples as a USB DAC is given them, exact (the app's USB driver: DspSink, UsbAudioSink). Every sample is carried
 * as a left-justified signed 32-bit word — a 16-bit sample in its top 16 bits, a 24-bit one in its top 24, a 32-bit
 * one as it is — and cut to the DAC's slot by taking its top bytes. So a sample no deeper than the slot reaches the
 * DAC bit for bit, padded with zeros (16-bit in a 32-bit slot: s × 65536), the same words SQ-tool's fingerprint
 * reads; a deeper one loses its lowest bits, undithered.
 *
 * A value in [-1, 1) is a word × 2⁻³¹, both ways: the decoders' 16- and 24-bit samples are exact in float, and come
 * back to the same word. (The scale was 2³¹ − 1 one way and 2³¹ the other: every 24-bit sample reached a 32-bit
 * slot one below its own word, and a 16-bit slot's loudest samples one below.)
