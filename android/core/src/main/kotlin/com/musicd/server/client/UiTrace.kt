/**
 * The log's watch on the app's screens (bug list items 116 and 121, while logging is on): what a smooth app
 * never does, found in what the screens show and when. It is told each change of what is shown ([shown]: the screen on
 * top, the side menu or a sheet over it), the back stack after each move ([stack]) and each frame's length ([frame]),
 * and answers with what was wrong:
 *
 * - FLASH: something shown for a moment between two others (the side menu closed, Home seen, then Settings);
 * - BOUNCE: something gone to and straight back (a screen opened and closed again by itself);
 * - STACK: a back stack with nothing, without Home at its foot, or the same screen twice in a row (item 115's kind),
 *   the screens named as the log names them (an album with its number, Settings with its page);
 * - JANK: a frame that took long enough to be seen as a stall.
 *
 * Frames that are slow but not stalls are counted by what was shown ([slowFrames]), for a summary now and then.
