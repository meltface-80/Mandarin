/**
 * A look repeated now and then, one loop of it however often it is started again (bug list item 193): the app's live
 * look at the server (ServerReach) every quarter of a minute while on screen.
 *
 * Started again (on screen again, a network lost) while a look was out, the old way only took back the next look not
 * yet posted, and the look out posted its own next one when it came back: two loops from then on, and another with each
 * start, the server asked more and more often. Each start here is a turn of its own, and a look's next is posted only
 * while its turn is the current one ([start], [stop]).
 *
 * [post] runs a runnable after a delay and [unpost] takes one back (a Handler's postDelayed and removeCallbacks), both
 * on the one thread the loop is used from. [look] makes one look and calls its argument with the delay to the next, or
 * not at all to end the loop.
